## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs are tracked in this repo's GitHub Issues, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage labels (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`), plus a repo-specific `spec` label for issues published by `/to-spec`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root (created lazily by `/domain-modeling`). See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Releases

Releases are automatic. See `docs/agents/releases.md` for pull request title rules, release behavior, and failure recovery.

# Payload Toolkit

I like ambitious ideas, simple systems, and software that feels obvious. Do not preserve complexity just because it already exists. Do not introduce machinery because it looks architecturally impressive. Understand the real constraint, then fight for the smallest model that makes the correct behavior unsurprising.

Channel both "measure twice, cut once" and "yagni". Fight scope creep. Try to honor the dev's intent in both a minimal and realistic fashion.

The rest of this document is meant to help you navigate the codebase and make changes effectively. Think of these instructions less as "hard rules", more as "good defaults". The developer's preferences should be able to override anything here.

## Deep Modules

Prefer deep modules: small interface, deep implementation. A few methods with
simple params hiding complex logic behind them.

Avoid shallow modules: large interface with many methods that just pass through
to thin implementation. When designing, ask: can I reduce the number of methods?
Can I simplify the parameters? Can I hide more complexity inside?

## Performance

Lots of apps have gotten bogged down with bad tech decisions and "slop". We have not, and we're proud of the performance of our packages. We regularly audit for performance regressions, often caused css animations causing gpu spikes, lists being hard to render, and more. Make sure all changes are considerate of performance impact.

## Pull requests

- Never make a PR unless the developer explicitly asks you to do so.
- Conventional commit titles, plain language: `fix(web): new threads no longer spike CPU`.
- Body: the problem in a sentence or two, then how you fixed it. End with the model and harness that did the work.
- UI changes need before/after images. Motion or timing needs a short video.
- One concern per PR. If the description says "also", split it.
- When babysitting: poll checks and comments newer than the last push, verify each bot finding against the source, fix real ones, dismiss false positives with a written reason. Stay quiet when nothing is new. Stop when the bots are green on the latest commit.

## Taste

- Complexity belongs at the adapter boundary. Orchestration stays pure, UI stays dumb.
- Inferred types over annotations. `any` is the enemy.
- Comments describe how a thing is used, and move when the code moves. To be used mostly to describe functions, not to annotate every line of behavior.
- Our users drive agents all day and notice a dropped frame, a lying spinner, and a stale label. No continuously repainting animations; they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.
- If a rule here fights the task in front of you, say so loudly and get a human sign-off before breaking it.

## Additional tips

- Don't verify with browsers or computer use unless the user explicitly agrees or requests it.
- Security is important, but should not be over-indexed on, especially for dev mode/maintainer-only features.
